                 <p>I am a Senior Analyst at Analysis Group specializing in health economics 
                 and outcomes research. My work evaluates the clinical and economic impacts of 
                 emerging medical therapies through statistical analysis and evaluative modeling. 
                 These research projects have been published in peer-reviewed journals, 
                 presented at academic conferences, and relied upon by global regulatory agencies
                 in health technology assessment submissions. 
                 </p>
                 <p>At Analysis Group, I also coordinate healthcare pro bono research 
                 efforts on behalf of the firm, managing over 50 ongoing research teams 
                 collaborating with multiple global health nonprofits. 
                 I am a member of the associate board for the International Alliance for Medical Action (ALIMA).

	      <div>
                 <p>At Analysis Group, I have worked on numerous modeling projects to evaluate the 
		 impact that novel pharmaceutical interventions are estimated to have on the existing
		 patient population. Select case examples include a cohort Markov cost-effectiveness model
		 comparing long-term clinical and economic benefits of anti-obesity medications and a population
		 model estimating the impact of a novel cell therapy on racial disparities among patients
		 indicated for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Other projects include matching-adjusted
		 indirect comparisons among treatments for the same indicated disease and physician chart reviews to
		 inform evaluations of treatment patterns, real-world effectiveness, and burden of illness.
		 </p>
	         <p>Through multiple pro bono engagements, I have also had the opportunity to work on 
	          data analysis for NIH-funded clinical trials in HIV and tuberculosis research, impact
	 	  modeling for large-scale COVID-19 contact tracing programs, and grant proposal-writing to 
		  support continued global health research.
	          </p>
	          <p>Outside of work, I am interested in understanding the role of healthcare as a soft power tool
		  in international relations. Specifically, I am interested in evaluating the evolving role that 
	          healthcare holds in diplomatic relations and conflict. This fall, I will begin pursuing my doctoral
	          studies in political science at Harvard University.

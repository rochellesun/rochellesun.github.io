		<p>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at 
		Harvard University, where I also hold affiliations with the Center for American Politics,
		the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
		My research evaluates the role of healthcare provision 
		in diplomatic relations, governance, and conflict. Additionally, I support 
		research on optimizing HIV care services in settings of conflict and instability 
		through my work with the GHESKIO centers in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.</p>
                <p>Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a health economics 
                and outcomes research (HEOR) analyst specializing in cost-effectiveness modeling
	        and indirect treatment comparisons. I have also had the opportunity to support research 
			at the European Parliament 
		in Brussels, Belgium, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) 
		in Washington, DC. I received my bachelor's in Political Science and Health Policy 
		from the University of Rochester. I am a member of the Board+ for the
		Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and the Hatian Global Health Alliance (HGHA).

	      <div>
		 <p>My dissertation project analyzes the role of healthcare as a strategic
			resource in conflict and development. One of my projects aims to identify 
			 the conditions under which combatants target healthcare resources with violence, 
			 particularly when such resources provide value for members or supporters 
			 of the perpetrating group. A second project attempts to evaluate the long-term
			 political and economic impacts of partisan shocks to foreign aid delivery in
			 recipient countries. By integrating insights from political economy, 
			 conflict studies, and global health, my research agenda hopes to delineate
			 the pathways through which healthcare provision shapes politics and 
			 power dynamics, particularly in low-resource settings.</p>
                 <p>Highlights of my HEOR experience include cost-effectiveness analyses of
		 anti-obesity medications and population modeling to estimate the impact of novel
		 cell therapies on reducing racial disparities among patients indicated for hematopoietic stem 
		 cell transplantation. Other projects include matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons, 
		 network meta-analyses, patient surveys, and physician chart reviews.
		 </p>
	         <p>Through my partnerships with global health non-profits, I have also had the opportunity 
		  to work on data analysis for NIH-funded clinical trials on HIV and tuberculosis research in Haiti, 
		  impact modeling for large-scale COVID-19 contact tracing programs in Massachusetts, and program development
		  and evaluation to improve global health service provision.

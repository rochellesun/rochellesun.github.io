		<p>I am a first-generation PhD student in the Department of Government at 
		Harvard University. My research evaluates the role of healthcare provision 
		in diplomatic relations, governance, and conflict. Additionally, I support 
		research on optimizing HIV care services in settings of conflict and instability 
		through my work with the GHESKIO centers in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.</p>
                <p>Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a health economics 
                and outcomes research (HEOR) analyst specializing in cost-effectiveness modeling
	        and indirect treatment comparisons. My research has been published in 
	        peer-reviewed journals, presented at academic conferences, and relied upon 
		by global regulatory agencies during health technology assessments.</p>
		<p>I have also had the opportunity to support research at the European Parliament 
		in Brussels, Belgium, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) 
		in Washington, DC. I received my bachelor's in Political Science and Health Policy 
		from the University of Rochester in 2019. I am a member of the associate board for the 
		International Alliance for Medical Action (ALIMA).

		 <p>My current research explores the intersection of health, diplomacy,
			 and security.</p>
                 <p>Highlights of my HEOR experience include cost effectiveness analyses of 
		 anti-obesity medications and population modeling to estimate the impact of novel
		 cell therapies on racial disparities among patients indicated for hematopoietic stem 
		 cell transplantation. Other projects include matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons, 
		 network meta-analyses, patient surveys, and physician chart reviews.
		 </p>
	         <p>Through my partnerships with global health non-profits, I have also had the opportunity 
		  to work on data analysis for NIH-funded clinical trials in HIV and tuberculosis research, 
		  impact modeling for large-scale COVID-19 contact tracing programs, and grant proposal-writing 
		  to support continued improvement in global health service provision.

                 <p>I am a Senior Analyst at Analysis Group specializing in health economics 
                 and outcomes research. My work evaluates the clinical and economic impacts of 
                 emerging medical therapies through statistical analysis and evaluative modeling. 
                 These research projects have been published in peer-reviewed journals, 
                 presented at academic conferences, and relied upon by global regulatory agencies
                 in health technology assessment submissions.

                 efforts on behalf of the firm, managing over 50 ongoing research teams 
                 collaborating with multiple global health nonprofits.

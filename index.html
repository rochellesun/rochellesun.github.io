		<p>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at 
		Harvard University, where I also hold affiliations with the Center for American Politics,
		the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
		My research evaluates the role of healthcare provision 
		in diplomatic relations, governance, and conflict. Specifically, I analyze the impact of 
		international health aid on political and economic outcomes in recipient localities and 
		investigate variation in the responses of combatants to healthcare providers in 
		conflict-affected areas. Additionally, I support 
		research on optimizing HIV care services in settings of conflict and instability 
		through my work with the GHESKIO centers in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.</p>
                <p>Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a health economics 
                and outcomes research (HEOR) analyst specializing in cost-effectiveness modeling
	        and indirect treatment comparisons. I have also had the opportunity to support research 
			at the European Parliament 
		in Brussels, Belgium, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) 
		in Washington, DC. I received my bachelor's in Political Science and Health Policy 
		from the University of Rochester. I am a member of the associate board for the 
		Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA).

	      <div>
		 <p>My dissertation research focuses on analyzing the role of healthcare as a strategic
			 asset in conflict. To do this, I plan to evaluate the conditions under which 
			 combatants target healthcare resources, particularly when such resources provide
			 care for members or supporters of the perpetrating group. My other research evaluates
			 the political and economic impacts of partisan shocks to foreign aid delivery and the
			 effects of subnational variation in implementation aid allocation. By integrating 
			 insights from political economy, conflict studies, and global health, this research
			 agenda seeks to illuminate the dynamic ways healthcare provision shapes politics and 
			 power dynamics in the modern international system.</p>
                 <p>Highlights of my HEOR experience include cost-effectiveness analyses of
		 anti-obesity medications and population modeling to estimate the impact of novel
		 cell therapies on racial disparities among patients indicated for hematopoietic stem 
		 cell transplantation. Other projects include matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons, 
		 network meta-analyses, patient surveys, and physician chart reviews.
		 </p>
	         <p>Through my partnerships with global health non-profits, I have also had the opportunity 
		  to work on data analysis for NIH-funded clinical trials in HIV and tuberculosis research, 
		  impact modeling for large-scale COVID-19 contact tracing programs, and grant proposal-writing 
		  to support continued improvement in global health service provision.
